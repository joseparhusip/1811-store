                        <p>
                            We took the name 1811 from the year of birth of Raden Saleh, a great Indonesian artist. We are inspired by him because we believe that art is a way for humans to freely express their feelings.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Through the name 1811, we want to bring that spirit into each of our works. We believe that everyone has a story, has feelings, and has the right to express themâ€”one way being through what they wear.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At 1811, we don't just make clothes; you can create designs that hold meaning, that can become part of your identity and lifestyle.
                        </p>
